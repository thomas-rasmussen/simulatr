How are funtions to be named? There are 3 "groups" of functions currently:

1) Functions that simulate (correlated) variables
sim_vars: simulates (correlaated) variables intended to be used as covariates

2) Functions that simulates a single variable where associations with other vairables can be controlled
sim_indicator: simulates an indicator, intended to be used as exposure, missingness indicator. Could probably be generalized
to also be used with an glm model to also genearitng contnuous variables

3) Functions that simulates an "outcome" with a specified marginal/conditional effect of an "exposure" on that outcome.
induce_indicator
induce_timtoevent

Naming is not that gookd currently. Think aobut if this can be improved to make things more intuitive.

consider implementing functions from extraDistr from scratch to avoid dependency on package
